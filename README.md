# Drift

Our project is a thrifting web/mobile application which will be a software service specifically for public users to buy and sell thrifting goods.  Individuals will be able to make an account, post items to their page for others to see, and peruse the application to see what other sellers are putting up for sale.  Our web application will be a dashboard for thrifting fanatics everywhere to search for specific items and/or look for other recommended items based on what they themselves have previously purchased before.  Our project will pave the way for a more sustainable thrifting experience while making it easier than ever to buy/sell, connect with other thrifters, and discover all types of second hand items.
