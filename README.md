## Team 12 - Senior Capstone Project, UNR CSE Department

Drift is a thrifting mobile application as well as a software service specifically for public users to buy and sell thrifting goods (I.e., an e-commerce app for thrifting specifically).  Our project is important because it will pave the way for a more sustainable thrifting experience while making it easier to buy/sell, connect with other thrifters, and discover all types of second hand items.  The major features that we intend to design and implement are user login/signup authentication, item posting, item discovery and querying, cart use, checkout, and chat functionality.  Our thrifting and e-commerce centralized application will provide a virtual thrift shopping experience for browsing for items, posting items to sell on oneâ€™s profile, and perusing saved items.
